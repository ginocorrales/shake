shake for Pebble
======

shake allows any two people wearing a Pebble to quickly exchange contact information simply by shaking hands. shake takes advantage of the Pebble's motion sensors to detect when a handshake motion has occurred, and an Express backend evaluates the raw data along with location-based information to determine which two people shook hands. Upon confirmation, both parties receive the contact information of the person they just met.
