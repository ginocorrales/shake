###*shake* allows any two people wearing a Pebble to quickly exchange contact information by simply shaking hands

shake takes advantage of Pebble's motion sensors to detect when a handshake has occurred. An Express backend evaluates the raw handshake data along with location-based information to determine which two people shook hands. Upon confirmation, both parties receive the contact information of the person they just met.
